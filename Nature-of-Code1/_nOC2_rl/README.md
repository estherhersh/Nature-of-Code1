# Nature-of-Code
trying to fix organziation slash understand how git works. i think that bc you made Nature-of-Code1 folder it has to be the master? maybe not. i dunno. i'm putting everything in there. i renamed yr assignment and started putting all the assignment folders in the master Nature-of-Code1
